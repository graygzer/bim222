    <p> Set in South Carolina in 1964, The Secret Life of Bees tells the story of Lily Owens,
       whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed.
        When Lily's fierce-hearted black "stand-in mother," Rosaleen, insults three of the deepest
       racists in town, Lily decides to spring them both free. They escape to Tiburon,
          South Carolina--a town that holds the secret to her mother's past. Taken in by an eccentric
           trio of black beekeeping sister, Lily is
       introduced to their mesmerizing world of bees and honey, and the Black Madonna.
        This is a remarkable novel about divine female power, a story that women will share
         and pass on to their daughters for years to come.
